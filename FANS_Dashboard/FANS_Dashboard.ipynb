    "\n",
    "Before diving into analysis or visualization, it’s crucial to understand the structure of your data. This can be done using the `identify_hierarchy` function. This function traverses the HDF5 file and returns a dictionary that represents the hierarchical structure of the data, including microstructures, load cases, and time steps. Each dataset's name and shape are captured, giving you a detailed map of the contents of the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "After identifying the structure, you can summarize it to get a quick overview of what’s inside your HDF5 file using `summarize_hierarchy`. This function prints a summary to the console, including the number of microstructures, load cases, time steps, and available quantities for each load case. \n",
    "<!-- For example, you might see output like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Found 1 microstructure(s):\n",
    "  Microstructure '/sphere/32x32x32/ms' has 1 load case(s):\n",
    "    Load case 'load0' has 51 time step(s) and the following quantities:\n",
    "      - absolute_error with shape (1,)\n",
    "      - displacement with shape (32, 32, 32, 3)\n",
